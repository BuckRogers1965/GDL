# A State-Driven Game Description Language for Turn-Based Games

**Abstract**

We present a declarative, JSON-based game description language (GDL) for specifying turn-based board and card games. Unlike traditional game implementations that hardcode rules in imperative programming languages, our approach treats games as state machines where all rules emerge from state-dependent action validation. The system demonstrates that complex game mechanics—including dynamic rule changes, multi-step interactions, and conditional effects—can be expressed through a simple condition-effect paradigm evaluated against current game state.

---

## 1. Introduction

Traditional board game implementations suffer from tight coupling between game rules and implementation code. Adding a new game or variant requires modifying source code, and game logic becomes scattered across imperative functions. This makes games difficult to modify, test, and reason about formally.

We propose a state-driven game description language where:
1. All game knowledge is encoded in declarative JSON specifications
2. A generic interpreter evaluates rules without game-specific code
3. Game state is the single source of truth for all decisions
4. Rules emerge from validating actions against current state

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

The core principle is: **Initial state + allowed actions → state changes → new rules**

This creates a feedback loop where:
- State determines which actions are legal
- Actions modify state
- Modified state changes which actions become legal
- Complex behaviors emerge from simple primitives

---

## 2. Language Structure

A game specification consists of seven primary sections:

### 2.1 Metadata
Basic game information (name, description, version).

### 2.2 Players
Defines player roles and their attributes:
```json
"players": {
  "roles": [
    { 
      "name": "White", 
      "attributes": { 
        "home_row": 0, 
        "pawn_direction": 1,
        "promotion_row": 7 
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Player attributes enable parameterized rules that work symmetrically for all players despite different board positions or movement directions.

### 2.3 Entity Schemas
Defines game piece types and their attributes:
```json
"entity_schemas": {
  "types": {
    "Piece": {
      "attributes": {
        "owner": { "type": "player_ref" },
        "rank": { "type": "string", "default": "pawn" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Entities are the atomic game objects (chess pieces, checkers pieces, cards, tokens).

### 2.4 Topology
Defines the game board structure:
```json
"topology": {
  "type": "discrete",
  "structure": "grid(8, 8)"
}
```

Currently supports grid-based boards. Future extensions will include:
- Networks (for games like Risk)
- Tracks (for games like Monopoly)
- Zones (deck, hand, discard pile for card games)

### 2.5 State Schema
Defines global game state variables:
```json
"state_schema": {
  "global": {
    "current_player": { "type": "player_ref", "initial": "player('White')" },
    "turn_direction": { "type": "int", "initial": 1 }
  }
}
```

State variables enable:
- Turn order tracking
- Phase management
- Dynamic rule modifications
- Game mode flags

### 2.6 Interactions
The heart of the system. Defines all possible actions:
```json
"interactions": {
  "list": {
    "pawn_move": {
      "conditions": [
        "eq(entity.owner, state.current_player)",
        "eq(entity.rank, 'pawn')",
        "eq(board[target], null)",
        "eq(sub(target.y, start.y), entity.owner.pawn_direction)"
      ],
      "effects": [
        "set(board[start], null)",
        "set(board[target], entity)",
        "set(entity.pos, target)"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each interaction specifies:
- **Conditions**: Predicates evaluated against current state
- **Effects**: State modifications to apply
- **Chainable**: Whether action can be part of multi-step sequences

### 2.7 Game Flow
Defines turn structure and legal action sets:
```json
"game_flow": {
  "time_model": "turn_based",
  "phases": {
    "main_turn": { 
      "actors": "current_player",
      "allowed_actions": ["pawn_move", "knight_move", "capture"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Expression Language

The system uses a LISP-like functional expression language for conditions and effects:

### 3.1 Comparison Operations
- `eq(a, b)` - equality
- `ne(a, b)` - inequality  
- `gt(a, b)`, `lt(a, b)` - ordering

### 3.2 Logical Operations
- `and(a, b, ...)` - conjunction
- `or(a, b, ...)` - disjunction
- `not(a)` - negation

### 3.3 Arithmetic Operations
- `abs(x)` - absolute value
- `sub(a, b)` - subtraction
- `mul(a, b, ...)` - multiplication

### 3.4 Game-Specific Functions
- `mid_pos(start, target)` - midpoint calculation
- `path_clear(start, target)` - line-of-sight checking
- `other_player(p)` - opponent reference

### 3.5 Property Access
Dot notation for nested properties:
- `entity.owner.direction`
- `entity.rank`
- `state.current_player`

### 3.6 Bracket Access
Array/dictionary indexing:
- `board[target]`
- `board[mid_pos(start, target)]`

---

## 4. State-Driven Execution Model

### 4.1 Action Validation
When a player attempts an action:

1. **Parse Input**: Convert user input to start/target positions
2. **Identify Entity**: Retrieve entity at start position
3. **Find Valid Action**: For each allowed action in current phase:
   - Evaluate all conditions against current state
   - First action with all conditions satisfied is selected
4. **Execute or Reject**: Apply effects if valid, otherwise report error

### 4.2 Multi-Step Actions
Some games allow chaining actions (checkers jump sequences):

```json
"man_jump": {
  "chainable": true,
  "conditions": [...],
  "effects": [...]
}
```

The engine:
1. Validates each segment of the path independently
2. Applies effects cumulatively in simulation
3. Commits all changes only if entire path is valid
4. Requires all steps use chainable actions

### 4.3 Conditional Effects
Effects can be conditional:
```json
"effects": [
  "set(board[target], entity)",
  "if(eq(target.y, entity.owner.promotion_row), set(entity.rank, 'queen'))"
]
```

This enables promotion, capture, and other context-dependent outcomes.

---

## 5. Key Design Patterns

### 5.1 Symmetric Rules via Player Attributes
Instead of separate rules for each player:
```json
"conditions": [
  "eq(sub(target.y, start.y), entity.owner.pawn_direction)"
]
```

White pawns move `+1`, Black pawns move `-1`, both using the same rule.

### 5.2 Dynamic Rule Changes
State variables control which actions are legal:

**Uno Reverse Example:**
```json
"reverse_card": {
  "effects": [
    "set(state.turn_direction, mul(state.turn_direction, -1))"
  ]
}
```

Next player calculation now references `state.turn_direction`.

### 5.3 Phase-Based Constraints
Different action sets per phase:
```json
"phases": {
  "roll_phase": { "allowed_actions": ["roll_dice"] },
  "move_phase": { "allowed_actions": ["move_piece", "pass"] },
  "build_phase": { "allowed_actions": ["build", "end_turn"] }
}
```

### 5.4 Entity State as Rules
An entity's attributes determine its capabilities:
- `rank: 'man'` → can only move forward
- `rank: 'king'` → can move in any diagonal direction

The same piece type with different rank values has different legal moves.

## 6. Implementation Architecture

### 6.1 Components

**GameState**: Container for all mutable game data
- Players
- Entities  
- Board (spatial mapping)
- Global state variables
- Topology metadata

**ExpressionEvaluator**: Pure functional expression interpreter
- Evaluates condition predicates
- Computes effect expressions
- No game-specific knowledge
- Context-based evaluation

**GamePresenter**: Orchestrates game execution
- Loads specifications
- Initializes state from setup
- Validates and executes actions
- Renders board state
- Manages turn flow

### 6.2 Separation of Concerns

The evaluator is deliberately isolated from game logic:
```python
class ExpressionEvaluator:
    """Generic expression evaluator - knows NOTHING about game rules"""
    
    def eval(self, expr, context):
        # Parse and evaluate expression against context
        # No chess, checkers, or game-specific code
```

This ensures:
- New games require zero code changes
- Game rules cannot "leak" into the engine
- Testing focuses on expression semantics, not game logic

---

## 7. Case Studies

### 7.1 Checkers
Demonstrates:
- Multi-step chainable jumps
- Promotion via conditional effects
- Mandatory capture rules (via action priority)

Key insight: Forced jumps are the only legal actions when jumps exist. This is expressed by making jump actions evaluate conditions first in the allowed actions list.

### 7.2 Chess
Demonstrates:
- Diverse piece movement patterns
- Path validation for sliding pieces
- Capture as move variant (same action, different target state)
- Pawn promotion

Key insight: Rooks, bishops, and queens all use the same `path_clear()` function. The difference in movement is purely in conditions, not in special-case code.

### 7.3 Potential Extensions

**Uno** (dynamic rules):
```json
"state_schema": {
  "global": {
    "turn_direction": { "type": "int", "initial": 1 },
    "draw_penalty": { "type": "int", "initial": 0 }
  }
}
```

**Monopoly** (resource management):
```json
"entity_schemas": {
  "types": {
    "Property": {
      "attributes": {
        "owner": { "type": "player_ref" },
        "buildings": { "type": "int", "default": 0 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 8. Advantages and Limitations

### 8.1 Advantages

1. **Declarative Specifications**: Game rules are data, not code
2. **Zero Code for New Games**: Add games by writing JSON
3. **Formal Reasoning**: Rules can be analyzed, verified, proven correct
4. **Variant Generation**: Small JSON changes create game variants
5. **AI/Solver Ready**: State space is explicit and queryable
6. **Tooling Potential**: IDE support, rule validators, visualization

### 8.2 Current Limitations

1. **No Randomness**: No dice, card shuffling, or probability
2. **No Hidden Information**: All state is visible (no hands)
3. **Limited Topology**: Only grids, no networks or zones
4. **No Resources**: Can't track money, cards in hand, etc.
5. **Sequential Evaluation**: Conditions evaluated in order, not optimized
6. **No Concurrency**: Turn-based only, no real-time games

### 8.3 Future Extensions

**Randomness:**
```json
"effects": [
  "set(state.dice_roll, random_int(1, 6))"
]
```

**Hidden Information:**
```json
"entity_schemas": {
  "Card": {
    "attributes": {
      "visible_to": { "type": "player_ref_list" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Zones:**
```json
"topology": {
  "type": "zones",
  "zones": {
    "deck": { "type": "stack", "visible": false },
    "hand_p1": { "type": "set", "owner": "player('P1')" }
  }
}
```

### 9.2 Rule Engines

Our approach resembles production rule systems (CLIPS, Drools):
- Condition evaluation against working memory (state)
- Action execution modifies working memory
- Forward chaining through state changes

*Difference*: We're specialized for turn-based games with spatial and ownership relationships.

## 10. Conclusion

We have presented a state-driven game description language that demonstrates:

1. **Declarative game specifications** separate from implementation
2. **State as the single source of truth** for all rule evaluation  
3. **Complex behaviors emerge** from simple condition-effect primitives
4. **Zero code changes** required to add new games
5. **Dynamic rule modification** through state variables

The system successfully implements chess and checkers with all standard rules, including promotion, multi-step moves, and diverse piece behaviors—all without game-specific code in the interpreter.

Future work will extend the language to support:
- Card games (randomness, hidden information, zones)
- Resource management (inventory, currency)
- Network topologies (territorial games)
- Simultaneous actions (real-time elements)

The fundamental insight is that treating games as state machines where rules are emergent properties of state validation creates a powerful, extensible framework for game implementation.
